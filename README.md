# HuffmanServer

A program that mimics a client and server. Client reads an input file, sends a list of Huffman Codes to a server. Server takes an input file of characters and frequencies, generates the Huffman tree, recieves the Huffman codes from the client, then returns the characters from the Huffman tree to the client. The client then prints out the original decoded message using the characters.
